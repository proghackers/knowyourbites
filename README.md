### TODO List:
- [ ] VideoToGif
1. Looked at the [VideoToGif Research Paper](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~gyglim/video2gif/cvpr16.php).
2. Currently trying to get their code working - [Code Location](https://github.com/gyglim/video2gif_code).
3. Meanwhile [gifs.com](https://gifs.com/auto-video?yid=6uIK3o32hig) already provides a way to summarize video to gif. All they want is 10$ a month to remove their logo at the bottom.


### Getting people onboard:
- [ ] Content
1. https://www.zomato.com/TheGirlWithFork   Talked. Has agreed to write for us. Has asked for a content strategy.
Also agreed to fix meetings with other foodies.
2. Negotiation and getting people onboard :
ELEVATOR PITCH SHOULD BE PREPARED

The restaurant space is a competetive space with there being very little way for restaurants to differentiate.
zomato listings are end points for users only if they specifically search for your business. There needs to be a way for them to know your name before they can search your name.
In the facebook attention economy marketing requires some expertise in understanding the digital medium. We use automated and human algorithms to generate content that is bound to expand reach of restuarant businesses.

### Probabale questions, B2B side
- [ ] FAQ / responses
1. I have my own facebook page. Why do i need yours ?
We have digital marketing expertise which means we understand how the content behaves on different social media.
A separate blog with high SEO on the internet makes sure that the content can be reached later by our blog viewers and hence make the content less transient.


2. I already have bloggers onboard who write a review on zomato for me, so i am not interested...
Bloggers have a very limited content to offer and the content distribution channels are weaker in terms of number of people targetted. Actual statistics for the impact they produce is unavailable.
zomato listings are end points for users only if they specifically search for your business. There needs to be a way for them to know your name before they can search your name.

3. I do not use social media, I am not interested.
The users that you are targetting do. Which means you are losing out on fresher audiences . Leave the marketing to us.


### Content Strategy:
- [ ] Classification
1. By type of content. videos, galleries , long form articles . 
2. Buying a new theme for wordpress. NECESSARY : Make sure other stacks can live on sub urls. i am talking about map based UI's and other bar crawl based UI.
3. digital marketing in the form of instadiaries should be used once we have crossed the threshold level of daily unique visitors. Deciding the actual number is subjective.
